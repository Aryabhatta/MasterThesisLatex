First, I wish to thank Prof.Dr. Burkhard Rost for giving me an opportunity to work in his group. Attending his lectures was the biggest source of inspiration for taking up a thesis in Rostlab. 

A very special thanks to my advisor, Juan Cejuela, for his patience, guidance and support throughout the thesis, particularly during the writing part. His time to time feedback was extremely valuable during the entire thesis. I also wish to thank my advisor, Tatyana Goldberg, for her help during the annotation of LocText, for proofreading my thesis and for all the encouragement. I extend my thanks to Tim Karl for kindly responding to my account related requests. A special thanks to Prof. Lars Juhl Jensen for his guidance during the publication of LocText. I also wish to thank my friend Ankit, for innumerable discussions on the thesis. I want to express my gratitude to the entire Rostlab for creating such a inspiring environment to work for.

Last but never the least, I wish to thank my parents and my sister for their unconditional love, support and encouragement. I dedicate this thesis to my family and thank them for helping me follow my dreams.
