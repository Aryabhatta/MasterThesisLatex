First, I wish to thank Prof. Dr. Burkhard Rost for giving me the opportunity to work in his group. Attending his lectures was the biggest source of inspiration for undertaking my thesis at Rostlab.

A very special thanks to my first advisor, Juan Miguel Cejuela, for his patience, guidance and support throughout the thesis, particularly during the writing part. The weekly meetings, feedback and suggestions were extremely valuable during the entire thesis. I also wish to thank my secondary advisor, Tatyana Goldberg, for her help during the annotation of LocText, for proofreading my thesis and for all the encouragement. I extend my thanks to Tim Karl for kindly responding to my account-related requests. A special thanks to Prof. Lars Juhl Jensen for his guidance during the publication of LocText. I also wish to thank my friend Ankit, for innumerable discussions on the thesis. I want to express my gratitude to the entire Rostlab for creating such a inspiring environment to work at.

Last but never the least, I wish to thank my parents and my sister for their unconditional love, support and encouragement. I dedicate this thesis to my family and thank them for helping me follow my dreams.
