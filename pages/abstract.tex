This thesis introduces a method to extract the instances of subcellular localization of proteins from the biomedical literature, using natural language processing. It involves extracting the semantic relationship between a protein entity and a subcellular location entity, present in the text. For the purpose of training the method, a new corpus "LocText", consisting of 100 MEDLINE abstracts, is annotated. We found out that for around 77\% of the protein-subcellular location relations in the abstract, the participating protein and subcellular location entities are either present in the same sentence or in the neighboring sentence. We try to extract such instances of relations where the participating entities are either in the same sentence or in the neighboring sentence.

Therefore, we train two machine learning models, viz. \textit{SSModel} for extracting same-sentence relations and \textit{DSModel} for extracting different-sentence relations. We make heavy use of dependency relations for training the models. For the abstracts in the LocText corpus, through combined predictions of \textit{SSModel} and \textit{DSModel}, we could achieve a \textit{Precision} of 66.57\%, a \textit{Recall} of 67.61\% and a \textit{F score} of 66.73\% on the development set and a \textit{Precision} of 61.01\%, a \textit{Recall} of 66.55\% and a \textit{F score} of 63.15\% on the test set.
