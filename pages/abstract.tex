This thesis introduces a method to extract the instances of subcellular localization of proteins, from the biomedical literature. The extraction of such instances involves extracting the semantic relationship between a protein entity and a subcellular location entity, present in the text. For the purpose of training the method, a new corpus "LocText", consisting of 100 MEDLINE abstracts and 4 PMC full-text articles, is annotated. It was found out that for 81\% of the protein-subcellular location relations in the abstract, the participating protein and subcellular location entities are either present in the same sentence or in neighboring sentences. I tried to extract such instances of relations where the participating entities are either in the same sentence or in neighboring sentences.

I trained two machine learning models, viz. \textit{SSModel} for extracting same-sentence relations and \textit{DSModel} for extracting different-sentence relations. Both models make heavy use of dependency relations between the tokens and use a lot of graph-based features for training. For the abstracts in the LocText corpus, through combined predictions of \textit{SSModel} and \textit{DSModel}, my method could achieve a precision of 61.01\%, recall of 66.55\% and F-score of 63.15\%.

For full-text subcorpus, it was found out that 92.2\% of protein-subcellular location relations are same-sentence relations. I also present the results of primary evaluation of \textit{SSModel} on the full-text subcorpus.
