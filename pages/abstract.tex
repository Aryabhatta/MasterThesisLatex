This thesis introduces a relation extraction method for extracting the subcellular localization of proteins from the biomedical literature. For this purpose, the semantic relationship between a protein mention and a subcellular location mention in the text is derived. A new corpus "LocText", consisting of 100 MEDLINE abstracts and 4 PMC full-text articles, is annotated for training the method. It was found out that for 81\% of the protein-location relations in the abstracts, the protein mention and the subcellular location mention is either present in a single sentence or in neighboring sentences. My method try to extract such relations in which the mentions are in a single sentence or in neighboring sentences. This is the first method that attempts to extract the protein-location relations from full-text articles, in addition to the abstracts.

I trained two machine learning models, viz. \textit{SSModel} for extracting same-sentence relations and \textit{DSModel} for extracting different-sentence relations. Both models make heavy use of dependency relations between the tokens and use a lot of graph-based features for training. For abstracts in the LocText corpus, through combined predictions of \textit{SSModel} and \textit{DSModel}, my method could achieve a precision of 61.01\%, recall of 66.55\% and F-score of 63.15\%.

For full-text subcorpus, it was found out that 92.2\% of protein-location relations are same-sentence relations. I also present the results of primary evaluation of \textit{SSModel} on the full-text subcorpus.
